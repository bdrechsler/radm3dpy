INSTALLATION
------------

radmc3dPy can be installed in two ways:

1) Standard python install with distutils

    $>python setup install

This will install radmc3dPy to the /usr directory, thus root privileges are likely to be needed

2) Manual install

    Add the directory where this file is located to the PYTHONPATH environment variable, and
    that is it. The best way to do so is in the .bashrc or .csrc files so it will automatically
    be loaded at every single shell startup. I.e. for bash add the following line to the 
    .bashrc file

    export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:ABSOLUTE-PATH-TO-THIS-DIRECTORY

    or for c-shell add the following line to the .csrc file:

    setenv PYTHONPATH ${PYTHONPATH}:ABSOLUTE-PATH-TO-THIS-DIRECTORY
