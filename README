INSTALLATION
-------------

The only thing one needs to install the radmc3dPy package is to add the path to the radmc3dPy directory
to the PYTHONPATH environment variable. One way of doing that is to run the configuration script with
the command

python configure.py

This will create two files sourceme.sh and sourceme.csh, which should be sourced, i.e. under bash
issue the command

source sourceme.sh

while under cshell

source sourceme.csh. This sets the PYTHONPATH variable, but only for the current shell. This means that
if the terminal is closed and a new is opened one needs to re-issue the source sourceme.sh/.csh commands. 
A way of setting the PYTHONPATH variable for every shell at startup is to add the following line to the
.bashrc or .cshrc file, depending on the shell type, in the home directory:

source path_to_the_sourceme.sh_file/sourceme.sh
