Changes

**Planned for v0.31**

* Nested mesh support
* Data inspector GUI

**v0.30**

* Python3 compatibility
* Integration of Mie-scattering code for dust opacity calculation
* New module (sphtool) for re-gridding 3D Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations to regular or AMR grids, 
  including some basic visualisation of the SPH simulations
* Possibility for modular module setup (i.e. generation of grids, variables, radiation sources, etc independently of each other)
  

**v0.29**

* Octree AMR support (read and write grid and data fields, generate models with an octree grid)
* Plot 2D contour maps of data fields along axis aligned slices (show the cell boundaries for AMR models) 
* Plot the polarisation direction for full stokes images (thanks Kees!)
* Read molecular data files (thanks Kees!)
* Plot spectrum (thanks Kees!)
* Functions to calculate dust and gas mass in a model
* Updated tutorials for models using an octree AMR grid
